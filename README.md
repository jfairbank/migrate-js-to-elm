# Migrate JavaScript to Elm

A simple note-taking React application for showing how to integrate with and migrate to Elm. This repo is meant to be used with the book _Programming Elm_.

Check the branches `01-add-image-uploader` and `02-migrate-all` for steps toward adding a new image upload feature in Elm and then migrating the whole application to Elm.

You can check the branches `old-01-multiple-notes-add-image-uploader`, `old-02-multiple-notes-migrate-note`, and `old-03-multiple-notes-migrate-all` to see a more complex version of the application with multiple notes.
