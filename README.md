# Migrate JavaScript to Elm

A simple note-taking React application for showing how to add an image upload feature with Elm and eventually migrate the entire application to Elm. This repo is meant to be used with the book _Programming Elm_.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Your browser should open the application in a browser tab.

1. `01-add-initial-image-uploader`
2. `02-upload-images`
3. `03-display-images`
4. `04-display-initial-images`
